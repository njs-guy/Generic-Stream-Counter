### An easy way to count things on your stream.

Setting up an on-screen counter is easy, but constantly changing it is *annoying*. Generic Stream Counter makes a text file for OBS or Xsplit to update it automatically. From there, it can be stylized just like any other text source.

# Branches
- *Main:* The stable branch as per usual.
- *Dev:* Code currently in development and is likely to not fully work as intended. This branch will merge with main when there is a new release.
- *v.X.XX:* Source code of previous versions.

# Features
