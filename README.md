# Generic Twitch Counter
Generic Twitch Counter (GTC) is a counter for Windows to count things on a Twitch stream. After changing the label and the current count, it is saved into a text file to be opened by streaming software such as OBS. GTC can be used as a regular counter, but this is the intended purpose. 

**To download, go to releases on the right side of the main Github page.**

# Branches
