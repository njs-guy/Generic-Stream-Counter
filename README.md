# Generic-Twitch-Counter
Generic Twitch Counter (GTC) is a counter to count things on a Twitch stream. After changing the label and the current count, it is saved into a text file to be opened by streaming software such as OBS. GTC can be used as a regular counter, but this is the intended purpose.

**To download, go to releases on the right side of the main Github page.**

Current To do:
- Make icon, logo, and other assets
- Add dark mode
- Change where text file is saved. Be able to turn off saving to text file.
- Resizing labels for about and help pages
- Better documentation
- Come up with more features and improvements. Feel free to leave suggestions.
