# Generic Twitch Counter
![Maintainer](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintainer-njshockey-blue)

Generic Twitch Counter (GTC) is a counter for Windows to count things on a livestream, such as the number of deaths or resets. After changing the label and the current count, it is saved into a text file to be opened by streaming software such as OBS. GTC can be used as a regular counter, but this is the intended purpose.

While there is currently no Mac or Linux version, GTC works well with WINE.

**To download, go to releases on the right side of the main Github page.**
